These are the github repositories for MinBZK.

Here we will post the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MinBZK/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), Contributing and Security documents that fit these types of repositories as soon as they are ready:

- code completely public and accessible
- code sourced from private repository here or elsewhere
- code that was made public due to a Woo request making it focused on transparency and not reuse
