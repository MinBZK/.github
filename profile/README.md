## Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties

These are the github repositories for MinBZK. We distinguish these three manifestations of repositories:

- code completely public and accessible
- code sourced from private repository here or elsewhere
- code that was made public due to a Woo request making it focused on transparency and not reuse

Some repositories contain code we use, other code can be experiments or ideas that we do not use.
